# Reflection on the Semester

As you look back on this semester, please take a moment to reflect on your experience, recognizing the challenges, successes, and all that you've learned along the way.

## Responding to Questions

### 1. Program I'm Particularly Proud Of

During this course, there were several programs that I was proud of, but the two that stood out to me the most were the 9-week milestone assignment on the shopping cart program and the adventure game that I made. The shopping cart program was one of the few assignments that I felt I truly understood and was able to complete myself without asking for much help. Despite getting frustrated at times, I was able to push through and figure things out on my own, which boosted my confidence. The program was more complex than some of the other assignments, which made it a more interesting project to work on.

I was also particularly proud of the adventure game that I made because it reminded me of the text-adventure games that I used to love playing as a kid even though I have not finished combining different games into one I still manage to create and complete the activity. Creating something like this seemed so complicated back then, but now that Iâ€™ve learned Python and was able to create my own game, it was an awesome feeling.

I am glad I took this course and am proud of the programs that I created during it. So from the two, I would consider the "one" program that I'm particularly proud of.

### 2. Using Skills in the Future

In the future, I plan to use the skills I learned in this course in various ways. Firstly, this course provided me with a solid foundation in programming, problem-solving, and debugging that I will build on throughout my studies and future career. These skills are essential to my major and will be useful for the rest of my life. As I continue my studies, the skills I gained in this course will be particularly important as they form the basis for more advanced courses. Additionally, I became a better problem solver by learning to think creatively and use available resources effectively. These skills will be beneficial for any course I plan to take in the future.

As a software developer major, the debugging and Python skills I acquired in this course will be especially valuable when I develop software in the future. I believe that the fundamental skills I learned in this course, not only in software development but also in problem-solving and critical thinking, will be helpful in my future career.

Moreover, I plan to use these skills in my personal life, such as for my photography and IT technician plan business, where I can use programming to create new ideas and make a difference in my community. I also want to use my skills to help others in my family, church, and community. This course has equipped me with a solid foundation of programming and problem-solving skills that I can build on in the future.

### 3. Gaining Confidence in Learning New Programming Skills

Throughout this course, I gained the confidence to learn new programming skills in the future. One experience that gave me this confidence was when I challenged myself to figure out problems on my own, without relying too much on external resources. I made use of online materials and videos to gain a better understanding, and this approach helped me to grasp concepts and complete assignments effectively. The last prove assignment was a breeze for me because of the skills I had learned throughout this course. This experience has been a major boost to my confidence and has made me feel prepared for learning new programming skills in the future. It has also helped me to overcome my fears and seek help when necessary. Even though some programs were quite challenging, but working through them using critical thinking and problem-solving helped me to create programs that I never thought I would be capable of. I believe that these skills will be useful in developing software and coding in the future, and I am excited to continue my learning journey.
