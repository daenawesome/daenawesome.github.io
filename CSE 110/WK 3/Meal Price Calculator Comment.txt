I believe I have completed most of the necessary steps for the Meal Price Calculator. I have not added any additional features or creativity for the activity yet. For the assignment submission next week, I want to contribute any fixes and other features I can think of. For example, I'll try to be more creative by providing input validation to ensure that the user enters valid values, prompt to calculate again, and try to include features like the option to include drinks, appetizers, or a tip percentage in the meal.
