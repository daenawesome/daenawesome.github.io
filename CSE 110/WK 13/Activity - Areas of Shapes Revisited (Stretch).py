"""
This program has been updated to allow the compute_area_square function to call the compute_area_rectangle 
function to compute the area of the square. This is accomplished by passing the side length twice to 
the compute_area_rectangle function.

The program also includes a new compute_area function that accepts a shape parameter and a variable 
number of arguments. It determines the correct function to call based on the shape parameter and then 
calls that function with the variable arguments. This allows it to compute the area of squares, rectangles, and circles.

To accommodate rectangles, the program now accepts calls like compute_area("rectangle", 7, 8), which 
passes two arguments to the compute_area function. The function makes use of a default value for the 
second parameter of the compute_area_rectangle function.

The main loop of the program has been updated to use the new compute_area function for all three calculations. 
The program now prompts the user for the shape of the object, and then the length(s) or radius, and then calls 
the compute_area function to compute the area. If the user enters "quit", the loop is exited. Otherwise, if an 
invalid shape is entered, the program prints an error message and prompts the user again. The computed area is 
then displayed using the print function.
