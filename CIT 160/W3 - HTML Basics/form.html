        <i>Sending letters has always been a great way to communicate over long distances.</i>
      </p>

      <p>
        Now you can send letters using any computer or mobile device, and within 3-7 days your message will arrive with one of our pigeons. Your friends and family will be thrilled to receive your custom message in such a fun and unique way.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pigeon is completely immune to cyber interception, and all messages are deleted from memory once sent. Everything is handled in the cloud, so you can send messages from anywhere.
