  <h1>A Business I Want To Start</h1>
<p>
I want to start a dog wash in our neighborhood, there are some in the city, and I
think it would be a great investment here!
It is pretty similar to a car wash, but it gives pet owners the space they need
to wash their dog, or other pet, without getting their bathrooms soaking wet!
It provides soap, air dryers, brushes, towels, and a big tiled private area to
get the job done!
The price for service depends on the size of the dog.
With a purchase of a dog wash, they would also receive a complimentary bandanna
from Lazy One and a small treat.
</p>
<p> 
I think it would be awesome to also have a little boutique along with the
baths. It would have some pet clothes, bows, bandannas, collars, toys, and an area
outside to let customers take their dogs to the bathroom.
I have seen a few of these businesses throughout Utah and I think it is a great
need that every pet owner needs close by.
