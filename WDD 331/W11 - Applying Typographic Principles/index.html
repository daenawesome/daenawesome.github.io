Because this is a third-party or custom application, the logical place for it is in <span class="code">/usr/local/appname</span>, possibly with a link to the program binary in the <span class="code">/usr/local/bin</span> directory (because that's in the path). </p>

      <h1>File Management Commands</h1>
      <p>A major section of the 101 exam is dedicated to how to run commands properly with the right options and arguments. As a good sysadmin, you'll be expected to know how to create, delete, edit, set permissions on, display, move, copy, and determine the type of files and programs.</p>

      <h2>Tips for working with Linux files</h2>
      <p>Because most users and sysadmins come from a Windows or other OS background, a quick set of recommendations for the less-experienced can be of help here:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Hidden files aren't really hidden</strong> - They just begin with a ., such as the <span class="code">.bashrc</span> and <span class="code">.bash_profile</span> files. These are not viewable by normal users with conventional commands and switches and aren't deleted by commands such as <span class="code">rm -f *.*</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Filenames can contain multiple periods or no period characters</strong> - The filenames <span class="code">this.is.a.long.file</span> and <span class="code">thisisalongfile</span> are perfectly reasonable and possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Spaces in filenames look nice, but are a pain to type</strong> - Use an _ or a - instead of spaces because it's neater and easier than prefixing all spaces with a <span class="code">\</span>. (To display a space in a filename, the system shows a space prefixes with a backslash.)
        </li>
      </ul>
