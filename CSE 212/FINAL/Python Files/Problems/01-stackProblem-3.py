"""
Implement a Python function named `reverse_words_in_phrase` that takes a single parameter `phrase` representing the input phrase. 
The function should return the input phrase with each word reversed.

You are given a phrase containing multiple words separated by spaces. 
Your task is to reverse each word in the phrase while maintaining the order of the words. 
To accomplish this, you should implement a Stack data structure and utilize it to reverse the words.

You should use the `Stack` class structure provided below to perform the word reversal. 
The `Stack` class has methods `push`, `pop`, and `is_empty`, which can be utilized to implement the word reversal logic.
"""

class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def push(self, item):
        # Implement your solution here
        pass

    def pop(self):
        # Implement your solution here
        pass

    def is_empty(self):
        # Implement your solution here
        pass

def reverse_words_in_phrase(phrase):
    # Implement your solution here
        pass

# Testing the function with the given phrase
phrase = "flow maws speed did mood"
reversed_phrase = reverse_words_in_phrase(phrase)
print(reversed_phrase)
