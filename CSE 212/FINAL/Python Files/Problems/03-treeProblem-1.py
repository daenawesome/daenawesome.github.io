"""
You are a system administrator responsible for managing a large network of servers used by your organization. 
Over time, the data stored on these servers has grown significantly, and it has become essential to optimize 
storage usage and identify potential issues. To achieve this, you decide to develop a directory analysis tool 
that provides valuable insights into the data distribution, identifies duplicate files, and calculates the total 
storage size across the network.
"""

"""
The script should symbolize a directory analysis tool that constructs a tree structure of a given directory's contents. 
It defines a class called `TreeNode`, representing nodes in the directory tree, with attributes like name, absolute path, 
size, and a list of children. The main function, `analyze_directory`, performs the directory analysis. It creates the 
root node for the directory and traverses through its subdirectories and files. During traversal, it skips special folders, 
hidden files/directories, and inaccessible ones due to permission issues.

The script calculates the total size of the directory and its subdirectories using the `calculate_total_size` function. 
It also counts the number of directories and files using the `count_directories_and_files` function and determines the 
maximum depth of the directory tree using the `calculate_max_depth` function. Additionally, the script identifies duplicate 
files within the directory tree using the `find_duplicate_files` function.

To use the script, the `main` function acts as the entry point. It accepts an optional directory path as input; if not provided, 
it analyzes the script's directory. The program then prints the directory tree structure, including each node's name and size. 
It displays the total size of the directory, the number of directories and files, the maximum depth of the directory tree, 
and any duplicate files found.

To run the script, users can replace the `main('')` line with the desired directory path they wish to analyze. Once executed, 
the program will display the analyzed directory's tree structure and relevant information about its contents. It serves as a 
helpful tool for understanding the file organization, sizes, and potential duplicates within a given directory.
