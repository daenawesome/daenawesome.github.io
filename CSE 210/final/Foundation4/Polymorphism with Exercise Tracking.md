This modified program represents a fitness activity tracker that allows users to log and view their exercise data. The program uses polymorphism to implement different types of activities such as running, cycling, and swimming, all derived from a common base class called `Activity`. Each activity has properties such as the date, length, and user ID, and provides methods to calculate and retrieve information about the activity, such as distance, speed, pace, and a summary.

Here's an overview of the key classes and their functionalities:

1. `Activity` class: This is the base class for all types of activities. It contains common properties like date, length, and user ID. It also provides virtual methods that can be overridden by derived classes to calculate specific information related to the activity.

2. Derived classes:
   - `Running`: Represents a running activity. It extends the `Activity` class and adds a `distance` property. It overrides the `GetDistance()`, `GetSpeed()`, `GetPace()`, and `GetSummary()` methods to provide specific calculations and a formatted summary for running activities.
   - `Cycling`: Represents a cycling activity. It extends the `Activity` class and adds a `speed` property. It overrides the `GetSpeed()`, `GetPace()`, and `GetSummary()` methods to provide specific calculations and a formatted summary for cycling activities.
   - `Swimming`: Represents a swimming activity. It extends the `Activity` class and adds a `laps` property. It overrides the `GetDistance()`, `GetSpeed()`, `GetPace()`, and `GetSummary()` methods to provide specific calculations and a formatted summary for swimming activities.

3. `Program` class: This class contains the main method and is responsible for handling user interactions. It loads exercise data from a file, displays a list of available users, allows the user to select a user, and based on the selection, either displays exercise data for the selected user or enters the admin mode to view exercise data for all users. It also prompts the user to go back to the main menu or exit the program.

The use of polymorphism in this program allows different activity types to be treated uniformly through the common `Activity` base class. The overridden methods in the derived classes provide specific implementations based on the activity type. This allows for code reusability, flexibility, and the ability to add new activity types in the future without modifying existing code that relies on the `Activity` base class.
