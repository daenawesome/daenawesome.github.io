      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Dry Oar Rafting is dedicated to creating cherished lifelong memories by providing outstanding experiences that exceed our guest’s expectations. 
      We are to help drive the rafting community into the future. From expedition boating to helping new people coming into the rafting world. With the belief that bringing people together in the outdoors and inspiring people to push their limits is the soul of rafting. We put our passion to work by developing initiatives focused on the wonders of rivers throughout the world. 
      We have this crazy passion for what we do, and when comes down to it, nothing makes us happier than sharing our passion with you. Without you, there is no way we could do our jobs day in and day out. </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This is the first part of our series aimed at welcoming new participants to the sport of whitewater rafting. If you are new to rafting, a first-timer, or you are getting a group together and don’t know what to expect whitewater rafting you probably want to know why would you go with a rafting company and what do they provide? </p>
      <p>The easy answer is: Just show up and we take care of the rest. That is the mantra of any good rafting company. </p>
      <p>Rafting is an adventure sport and there is a lot to think about before your first trip, but that’s the beauty of going with a rafting company you don’t have to worry about any of it. </p>

      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: ZCOOL KuaiLe  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        ZCool Kuaile was created by a team of font design trainees under the leadership of typographer Liu Bingke. First, Liu created the character shape framework and design standards; then, a group of over 100 typography apprentices participated in building out the character set. Finally, Liu and other designers from his workshop, including Yang Kang and Wu Shaojie, edited and adjusted the characters to unify the design.  <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Courgette  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        Courgette is a medium-contrast, brushy, italic-script typeface. The genre is traditionally used at large sizes but Courgette was carefully made for the web, with low stroke contrast that works well in smaller sizes and even in text.  <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p class="colored1">
        The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs.  Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.

      <h4>
        Colored paragraph example

      <p class="colored">
        Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for physically fit and experienced rafters.  No matter what type of river adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it happen for you.

        The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the pages in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or child pages.
      </p>  
      <p>
        The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the global navigation for the site.
      </p>
      <!--
Choose your pages that you will create and put the names inside the two child page boxes… Some suggestions are below:

•	FAQ
•	Blog
•	Contact Us
•	Rivers We Run
•	Schedule/Rates/Dates -->

        Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages.  They should show the major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative locations of each element.  In the wireframe below you can see there will be 6 sections to our page:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with "x" means an image) and the navigation bar.</li>
        <li>Then there is a banner image below the navigation bar with same widths.</li>
        <li>Next we have some text and an image </li>
        <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text (Left to Right then Right to Left).</li>
        <li>Then at a fixed position button that says "contact us"</li>
        <li>Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3  social media icons. </li>
      </ol>
