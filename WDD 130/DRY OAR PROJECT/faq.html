                  <p> Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are all over 8). A common concern we get from parents is that their children will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any age. The areas we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might see around any corner. Not to mention the rapids which keep things very interesting. Each boat also comes equipped with a guide. It has been proven that river guides are unable to go for very long at all without telling stories...some of which are even true! </p>

                  <p> By choosing our company, you have already reduced the risks associated with rafting. It is shown that by choosing a guided service, following the safety instructions given by your guide, and choosing a water level consistent with your ability level, the risks associated with whitewater rafting can be reduced. The majority of the time, minor bumps and bruises will be the most you might suffer from a day on the river. More significant injuries are possible, but can mostly be prevented by listening to the safety instructions given by your guide at the beginning of your trip. These will include everything from how to handle your paddle to how to behave if you do fall in. The most important things to remember are to always look down river and to keep your feet up. You can also count on having a certified and experienced guide who has a guiding license in New York State as well as first aid and water safety training. They carry the necessary first aid and safety supplies with them onboard as well. </p>

Coffee, tea and hot chocolate are provided during the morning and evening hours. You may bring beer, liquor and soft drinks (in reasonable amounts, 2 cans per day). You may purchase these items either the night before the trip, or on your way to the put-in. 3 meals per day, plus snacks. </p>

                  <p> It is best to bring only what you really need with you in the raft because there is always the chance that it can be lost in the river. Therefore, it's a good idea to leave any valuables including jewelry, wallets, and cameras that are not waterproof in your car or the office. That being said, if you have any medications that you might need they should be brought with you. You should let your guide know so they are able to help you in the event of a problem. Water, extra layers, and sunscreen are also a good idea depending on the weather conditions. </p>

                  <p> Cancellations must be received at least 14 days before the date of the trip. We are unable to issue refunds for late cancellations, no shows, and late arrivals. Changes to your reserved date will incur a 20% rescheduling fee. </p>
