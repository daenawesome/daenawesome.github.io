      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My goal is to create an unbiased medium to discuss established and popular podcasts, new upcoming podcasts, podcast news, and anything else I think might interest you. It’s time to find your next favorite podcast.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>You love podcasts. I love podcasts. You wouldn’t be here if you don’t. The problem, however, is around discoverability. Chances are you listen to a small number of podcasts during your workout or commute which you discovered in one of two ways:</p>

<p>You found it on the top of the podcast charts</p>
<p>Your friend recommended it</p>
      <p>The problem with the charts/ranking system is they are self-perpetuating — the top podcasts get more new users from searching the charts which then keep it on the top of the charts. Word of mouth is great, it just doesn’t occur nearly enough and it’s likely your group of friends’ interest fall in a narrow category.</p>

<p>That’s where PodCast Haven comes in. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->

        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Tajawal  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        Tajawal is a distinctive low contrast Arabic and sans serif Latin typeface family in 7 weights was created and designed by Boutros™ following a modern geometric style while still respecting the calligraphy rules of the Arabic script. Its fluid geometry makes it the perfect choice to use in both print and web applications, and alongside other Latin typefaces.  <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Fira Sans  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        Designed to integrate with the character of the Mozilla FirefoxOS, the Fira typefaces also aim to cover the legibility needs for a large range of handsets varying in screen quality and rendering.   <!-- change this -->
