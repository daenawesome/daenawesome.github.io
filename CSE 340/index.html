                This enhancement is a review of the concepts, skills and techniques that should have been learned in WDD 230 - Web Frontend Development 1. 
                It requires you to build a template and home page from that template for a ficticous web site - PHP Motors.

                    The pages will meet the standards shown in the Frontend Checklist.

                   The pages will use PHP modularization for the header, navigation and footer

                    The home page will include the content shown in the sample images

                <li>
                    Both pages will look similar to the images provided

                In this enhancement you will combine skills from the last two weeks to build a system into the phpmotors web site that is capable of delivering both a registration and login view to a site visitor when the "My Account" link in the page header on the PHP Motors site is clicked. 
                This process will require use of the MVC architecture.

            <h2>Recap</h2>
            <p>
                In enhancement 1 you applied your HTML and CSS skills to build a template and home page for the PHP Motors site. In enhancement 2 the databases were created and we got some practice in writing SQL statements to INSERT, UPDATE, SELECT and DELETE data and created a PDO connection object for each database within custom functions. In enhancement 3, we got used to working with the Model - View - Control architecture. Using the MVC, requires getting used to paths (moving things around), scope (making things available) and adjusting to sending everything through a controller so it can make decisions about what needs to happen. Integral to doing all of this is an understanding of key - value pairs and control structures that react to values found in key - value pairs. Whew! That's a lot in three enhancements.

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>In this enhancement we will take everything that we have done in all the weeks up to this point and apply them to new problems:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    getting a list of classifications (including both classification id's and names) from the database in order to produce a select drop down menu in an HTML form,
                </li>
                <li>
                    building a new controller and model for PHP Motors vehicles (inventory items),
                </li>
                <li>
                    building needed views for the vehicles process, and
                </li>
                <li>
                    adding new vehicles to the inventory table and new classifications to the carclassification table.
                </li>
            </ol>

                    add server-side validation to the new vehicles and new carclassification processes in the vehicles controller including making the new vehicle form "sticky" so previous entered values are maintained in the forms (don't worry about the new classification form since it only has a single input), and
                </li>
                <li>
                    make the creation of the $navList variable for building the site navigation easier, by creating a custom function for it in the "functions.php" page and then calling the function in all three controllers (phpmotors, accounts, vehicles) to store the navigation html data into a variable for use in all views.

            <p>
                This week's activities saw us make the navigation bar operational. When a classification name is clicked, that classification's vehicles, from the database, are delivered to a view. This enhancement asks you to take the next step - Specific vehicle information delivered to a view.            
            </p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>In this enhancement you will:</p>
            <ol>
				<li>Alter the code for each vehicle being delivered to the classification view so that a link exists for that specific vehicle. When the link is clicked, a "vehicle detail" view is delivered where complete details about that vehicle are displayed.</li>
				<li>Style the vehicle information to display clearly and professionally in any size browser window.</li>
			</ol>

			        	<li>The vehicle information is responsive and can be easily read on changing screen sizes without zooming or

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>In this enhancement you are asked to implement enhanced functionality for the site based on image uploads. This enhancement will consist of three general tasks:</p>
            <ol>
				<li>Run the current vehicle images through the new image upload tool, which will move them to a new location, and add their file path to the database.</li>
				<li>Revise some of the work that was done last week in order to get the vehicle details from the inventory table, but the path for the large, primary image from the images table.</li>
                <li>Add new functionality so that we can add vehicle thumbnails to the vehicle detail page and style everything to look professional.</li>
			</ol>
